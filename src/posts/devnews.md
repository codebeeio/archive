I finished the first release of a small project I've been working on called [devnews](https://devne.ws/). It's a site that you can visit daily for top Hacker News stories, GitHub's trending repositories, and top tech on Product Hunt.

It was really fun building it since this is my first React project. You can explore the [stack and source code on GitHub](https://github.com/devnews/web). I still think it can be improved by adding in infinite scrolling to Hacker News, and want to improve how the footer looks on each news item.
