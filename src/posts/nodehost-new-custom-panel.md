So before now the system uses vestacp on each node because of it's amazing API and light resource usage. So the panel on NodeHost would allow creation on our panel but make the user go to the vestaCP to work and manage the site.

**But no more.**

I have started building over the last 4-5 days a new panel, that uses the API to build into the main panel everything that is needed. It talks to the node servers VestaCP install via it's API to do all the work but keeps all user interaction on my NodeHost panel making things simple and easy. Check it out and give me feedback if you can.
