[socialshar.es](https://socialshar.es)

This is a project that started out as a small library but then I decided to go further with it when I bought the `socialshar.es` domain. It solves the problem of embedding share buttons without sacrificing page load performance, privacy, and inconsistent looking buttons.

There are multiple ways to install it (download, bower, or CDN), and can be customized whichever way you want since it's just HTML/CSS buttons. I use them here on CodeBee.

I want to add more features in the future and perhaps add a script embed option so that you can specify everything in a single embed. If you like the project or have ideas, let me know!
