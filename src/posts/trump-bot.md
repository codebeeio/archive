A couple weeks ago, I started work on a bot that would tweet things Donald Trump might say. It has just started so its not even close to good yet. I set up a twitter and tweeted out a couple of funny things it has said so far. To improve it I want to build a neural net, but obviously before that, I must learn **how** to build neural nets. 

Hopefully you will find something it said amusing.
