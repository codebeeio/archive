Over the past few months we've put in a lot of work on redesigning the [Ninjality Website](http://ninjality.com/). We wanted to focus our line of business more towards developing social platforms then to just a place for general web design and development. 

We feel as if our redesign has done that but we would love to hear your feedback about it! What do you think of the general design? Does it fit our target audience good? Any other suggestions?
