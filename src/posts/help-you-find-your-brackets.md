I have downloaded and configured a new plugin that i have never heard of before. You may have its called Bracket Highlighter for sublime. I dont know about you but i sometimes struggle to see the error in my code and usually its just one simple end bracket to close the tag or function for that matter. https://github.com/facelessuser/BracketHighlighter <- that is the solution for my problem and hopefully yours too.
