I have been working on this on and off for the last few months and I just wanted to share it here for anyone who wants a place to test with FAST servers running few sites per node. :) No over filling.

I have been moving my sites and client sites to it for some time now. If you have any feedback, feature requests or just want to give it a test, it has a free plan and gives credit for 1 week of next plan up for free.
