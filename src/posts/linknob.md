I have made some dramatic progress on my link sharing site, Linknob. I am rolling out some pre-beta invites this week as a Christmas present. If you'd like to test it out, be quick on those codes. The codes are for single use. I don't have all the features built or bugs fixed, but I'm proud of it so far. There aren't any guides for using it yet so if you have any questions you can comment or email me at [my first name] at jwbmedia.com.

Thanks!

**Edit:** Forgot to mention that I have some big updates and improvements coming in the next few days!
