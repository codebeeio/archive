A project I found while browsing Product Hunt today, and it looks very promising. Feathers is "a minimalist real-time framework for tomorrow's apps." It looks like an open-source alternative to Meteor that allows you to write web apps in JS (both server and client side). I like how it focuses on ES6 and can plug in any databases or tools (e.g. MySQL, React).
