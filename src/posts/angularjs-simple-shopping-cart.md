Hey everyone,

So who also likes to use Angular JS? I love it and I am not changing :joy: Anyway I am going to give you a quick example of how easy it is to make a shopping cart / basket using Angular.

I am assuming that you know how to set up angular in your app for this tutorial. If not, please head over to [their homepage](https://angularjs.org/) to get started.

Lets create a controller and call it CheckOutController

```
.controller('ChecOutController', function($scope) {

	
})
```
