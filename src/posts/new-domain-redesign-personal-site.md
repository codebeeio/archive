Starting off 2016 with a fresh new redesign of my personal site, as well as a domain change. The design is similar to my old one, but it's flatter and more organized. I didn't use any front-end framework, so the layout was mainly flexbox and a grid framework called [Lost](https://github.com/corysimmons/lost).

You can see the tech stack of the site on the projects page, but the main tools are Metalsmith (static site generator), PostCSS ("alternative" to Less/Sass), and Babel (JS compiler). It was refreshing to try out some new developer tools and I'm actually really liking PostCSS and Babel a lot.
